### Description
- Upload your submission json file in the submission folder, I will inference it and update the results on your filename for **every midnight (23:59)!**
- Try your best to get high performance (both accuracy and speed) before the deadline!
- Rank top3 on the leaderboard will be invited to make a presentation to share your methodology and get a bonus on your final score!

### Implementing
Notebook file was created in Google Colab
1. Download SVHN dataset.
2. Download the weights: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pLwvdiy1hkPGxGHKjmFFHMwPXvr6-D5E.
3. Run Google Colab and choose in the settings 'GPU'.
4. Zip dataset and weights and upload them to Google Colab.
5. Run notebook file.

There are two section in notebook file: Testing and Training. For testing you need to prepare one image and you can get speed evaluaion.
For training you need to use train dataset: https://github.com/penny4860/svhn-voc-annotation-format
